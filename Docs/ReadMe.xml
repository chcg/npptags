		<title>Introduction</title>
		<para>NppTags is a <ulink url="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">Exuberant CTags</ulink> plug-in for <ulink url="http://www.notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</ulink>.</para>
		<para>When you use Notepad++ to program in a popular programming language (like C/C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP), ctags can be very useful for you. It creates a so called tags file that can be used to navigate through your sources. This small tool can help you to jump to a selected function / variable / class / etc in your code by pressing just one key!</para>

	<sect1 id="install">
		<title>Installation Note</title>
		<para>For the plug-in to work properly it is important that ctags.exe is somewhere in the path, preferably in the XXXXx.</para>

		<title>How to use this plug-in</title>
		<para>This plug-in has two different ways to use:</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>FindTag tries to find the tag (function, variable, etc) under the cursor. If you want to jump to this tag simply press the assigned button. If there is only one reference found, you will be taken to it. Otherwise a dialog is shown where you can select the right one. If the tags is not found in the primary file, it will search the secondary file (as set in the options). Please be aware that the first time this file must be created, and from the root of my compiler's include directory it took more than 30 seconds.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>ShowTags shows all (recognized) tags in a tree. You can select a tag from the tree and you will be taken to it.</para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
	</sect1>

	<sect1 id="tree">
		<title>Tree</title>
		<para>Since ctags supports so many programming languages, it is impossible for me to add support for all these languages to the tree instantly.</para>
		<para>Based upon a combination of the documentation of ctags and personal testing, these languages should work quite well:</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>Classic ASP</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>C / C++</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>C#</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>Java</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>JavaScript</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>PHP</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>Python</para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>If your programming language isn't in the list and/or your type of tags don't show (properly) in the tree, contact me because it is not so difficult to add support for other languages/types.</para>
		<para>Note that this it only affects the tree, FindTag should not have any problem.</para>

		<title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>
		<qandaset>
			<qandaentry>
				<question id="faq_general_1"><para>
					Does NppTags recognize tags in language 'XYZ'?
				</para></question>
				<answer><para>
					NppTags relies on <ulink url="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">Exuberant CTags</ulink> for the recognition of tags. So please check the documentation of Exuberant CTags to see if your language is supported by Exuberant CTags. If not, you have to contact the Exuberant CTags team to see if he wants to add support for your programming language. If Exuberant CTags supports your language the FindTag mode of this add-in should have no problems, but the tree could not show all tags.
				</para></answer>
			</qandaentry>
			<qandaentry>
				<question id="faq_general_2"><para>
					How can I use NppTags when the sources are in a directory tree?
				</para></question>
				<answer><para>
					There are several ways. When you want to use one tags file for the entire tree, you need to set the Initial Folder of the Tools and set 'Always use full paths in the tags file' in the options.<br/>
					When you work with only one directory tree, you can set the Initial Folder to a full path.<br/>
					When you don't want this you could use a Workspace (located in the root of this directory tree) and set the Initial Folder to $WspDir. When you have a workspace loaded, this will put the tags in the same directory where the workspace is located. But if no workspace is loaded, it will work just like $FileDir.
				</para></answer>
			</qandaentry>
			<qandaentry>
				<question id="faq_general_3"><para>
					I want to add extra command line options the ctags generates the tags file. Can this be done?
				</para></question>
				<answer><para>
					If you want to add extra command line options to ctags, use a <ulink url="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/ctags.html#FILES">ctags.cnf</ulink> file. See the Files section in the documentation of ctags.
				</para></answer>

<!--
If the tags begin to get misplaced, you probably need to regenerate the tags file. The most easy way is open the ShowTags tree and press the Refresh button. The problem is that line numbers are the only way for me to jump to a tag. It would be great if TextPad would get native ctags support, so it can use the regex field to jump to a tag and not rely on line numbers. Or if they implement a DDE command Find (based upon regular expressions).
Do not try to use this tool in the root directory (c:\) of a harddisk. Because of the ctags -R flag it will search your entire disk for source files.
When you switch the case sensitive search you should regenerate all tags file, otherwise the fast binary search of readtags can not be used.
