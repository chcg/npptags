Introduction
============

NppTags is a `Universal Ctags`_ plug-in for `Notepad++`_.

When you use Notepad++ to program in a popular programming language
(like C, C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP), ctags can be very useful for you.
It creates a so called tags file that can be used to navigate through
your sources. This plug-in can help you to jump to a selected function /
variable / class / etc in your code by pressing just one key!

History
-------

There are several ctags based plug-ins for Notepad++, but none of them
really fits my needs. There are to limited (only jump, just one file,
based upon line numbers, etc) or to slow at startup. Back in 2002 and
2003 I wrote an add-on for TextPad named `FindTag`_. I used this code
base to create my own ctags based plug-in for Notepad++.
