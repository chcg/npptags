Known Issues
============

-  When you double-click in the tree the focus will not return to the
   edit window. I use the code from NppSnippets where it just works, but
   here is doesn't work. The context menu item ``Jump to Tag`` does work
   as expected.

-  Switching between files leaves the tree untouched when there is no
   tags files found for the new source file.
