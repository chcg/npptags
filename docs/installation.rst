How to install
==============

To manually install the plug-in, in the ``plugins`` directory in the Notepad++
installation directory, create a folder named ``NppTags`` and place ``NppTags.dll``
and ``ctags.exe`` in that directory. Then (re)start Notepad++.

Provided ctags executable
-------------------------

In the zip is a precompiled version of ``ctags.exe``. This is always a recent
version of the `Windows executables`_ provided by the `Universal Ctags`_ project
when the plugin was released.

You can always try to replace the provided version of ``ctags.exe`` with a
more recent version.
