How to compile
==============

To compile NppTags you can use `Visual Studio`_. Project files for VS 2019 are
provided and actively used. To compile with other versions of Visual Studio
you can convert the existing project files.

There is also a `MinGW-w64`_ ``Makefile``, using their 32-bit compilers. It
can be used from `Cygwin`_ and MSYS2. The debug build of this makefile is
not tested with ``gdb``.
